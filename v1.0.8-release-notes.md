# HSPARC v1.0.8 - Kiosk Mode Hotfix

## 🐛 Bug Fix

### Duplicate Window in Kiosk Mode
- Fixed duplicate studies window appearing with decorations in kiosk mode
- Issue: `mw.show()` was being called after `showFullScreen()`, creating two windows
- Solution: Only call `show()` when not in kiosk mode

This was causing the studies window to repeatedly pop up over other windows every 10-15 seconds in kiosk deployments.
